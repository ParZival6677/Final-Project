                in Smiljan, which was part of the Austrian Empire at the time and is now located in Croatia.
                He was the fourth of five children in his family and displayed an exceptional
                talent for engineering and mathematics from an early age.
                Tesla started his higher education at the Technical University in Graz,
                Austria, but then moved to the Karl-Ferdinand University of Prague to study electrical engineering.
                However, he did not graduate from university and in 1884 went to the United States,
                where he began a collaboration with Thomas Edison.

          <p>
              Nikola Tesla's career was marked by a number of breakthrough inventions and discoveries.
              He became a key figure in the "War of Currents",
              the struggle between Thomas Edison's direct current (DC)
              and Tesla's alternating current (AC) in the field of electric power transmission.
              Tesla's AC system eventually won out due to its efficiency in transmitting electricity over long distances.

            In his later years, Tesla faced financial difficulties
            and struggled to secure funding for his projects.
            He lived in various New York City hotels and continued
            to work on inventions and ideas, many of which remained unrealized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, in New York City at the age of 86.
            Despite his significant contributions to science and technology,
            he spent his later years in relative obscurity.

          <p>
              Tesla's legacy has grown significantly in the years following his death.
              He is regarded as a visionary inventor and a symbol of scientific innovation.
              The International System of Units (SI) unit for magnetic flux density,
              the "tesla," was named in his honor.
            </p>
            <p>
              In popular culture, Tesla has become an iconic figure, often depicted as a mad scientist
              or a symbol of the untapped potential of human creativity and scientific discovery.
              His work continues to inspire scientists, engineers, and inventors to this day.

              He was employed as an engineer at Edison Machine Works and quickly made an impression
              on Edison with his ingenuity and diligence. But the two men were very different characters.
              Edison was commercially focused, whereas Tesla was ideological and disinterested in the business side of things.
              Less than a year later, Tesla quit to form his own electrical company and worked as a laborer

                 and Tesla was given free rein to experiment. It was here that he worked on his alternating-current (AC)
                 electrical system, and several AC-based inventions, which he patented. In 1888,
                 businessman George Westinghouse purchased his patents for $60,000 and
                 stock in the Westinghouse Corporation. A race began between them and Edison with his direct-current (DC)
                 system. In 1893, Westinghouse Corporation was selected to supply the lighting at the World’s
                 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. And in 1895, an AC hydroelectric power plant was commissioned at Niagara Falls,
                 which was used to power Buffalo, New York. Edison had lost the race, and AC power is still
                 the dominant electrical system across the world..</div>

                   Tesla demonstrated the first-ever radio-controlled boat and went on to improve on his invention.
